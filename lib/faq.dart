  'Help! I don\'t know what Market, Limit and Stoploss orders are!': '''
These are the 3 types of orders that you can place. The type of order you select can change the trade price as well as how soon your order gets filled.

 - `Market Orders`: If your primary concern is to have your order filled ASAP, and you’re not too worried about the price at which the transaction is carried out, you should use a Market Order. Once you place a Market Buy Order for a certain company, we will find the least priced Market Sell Order (for the same company) and execute the transaction. (vice-versa for Market Sell)

- `Limit Orders` : Limit Orders allow you to specify a maximum trade price in case of a Limit Buy, and a minimum trade price in case of a Limit Sell. While these may take more time to be filled than a Market Order, they provide you with more control over the price at which the transaction is executed a.k.a trade price.

- `Stoploss Orders` : Stoploss orders are converted to Market Orders once the price crosses the Stoploss price that you set
    - Stopless Buys are converted to Market Buys as soon as the stocks price rises above the Stoploss price that you set.
    - Stopless Sells are converted to Market Sells as soon as the stocks price falls below the Stoploss price that you set.

*Pro Tip*: Since the market is open for four hours, Stoploss orders can be very useful in case the market fluctuates wildly when you're not online! You can use Stopless Buy Orders to jump on a rising trend and you can use Stoploss Sell Orders to lock in a profit/limit your losses.

  'What is this short selling you speak of?': '''
While you will buy a company's stock if you expect its price to go up, you can short sell a company’s stock if you expect its price to go down. In a nutshell, short selling means to sell stocks that you don’t own so that you can buy them back at a lower price.

To short sell stocks, Broker will lend the total number of stocks to your account, this will increase the total stockworth in the portfolio, These stocks are then placed as `Ask` orders.

Shorting is intra-day, so the stocks lended to you will be taken back, the difference in the stock worth is the Profit/Loss you made in this shorting.

After you short sell a company, if the stock price dips below the price you sold it for, then you will have made a profit and vice-versa.

Note: You can only short sell a maximum of 20 stocks per company per day.

  'What is the difference between Stocks in Exchange and Stocks in Market?': '''
- `Stock in Exchange` - The number of stocks that the Dalal Street Exchange currently holds.
- `Stock in  Market` - The number of stocks that are currently held by all of the players in the game.

When the game begins, the Stocks in Market will be zero since all stocks are initially held by the exchange. As soon as the market opens on Day 1 and players begin buying from the exchange, the number of Stocks in Market will increase and the number of Stocks in Exchange will decrease.

If the number of Stocks in Exchange is zero, it means that all shares of this company are currently in the hands of the players. Therefore, you can no longer buy shares from the exchange and instead, you'll have to place Buy Orders on the Company page to buy any stock.

  'How does mortgaging work?': '''
Mortgaging is a great tactic to use if you are in need of cash but are not willing to sell your stocks to other players. It consists of 2 steps

- `Mortgage` :  In this step, you will be selling your stocks to the exchange at the Deposit Rate (80% of the Current Stock Price).
- `Retrieval` : Here, you will be retrieving the stocks you initially mortgaged by paying the exchange at the Retrieval Rate (90% of the Mortgaged Price).

*Note* : After you mortgage a stock, it is no longer a part of your portfolio and hence, will not contribute to your stock worth (until you retrieve it). However, at the end of the game, users will be forced to retrieve all of their mortgaged stocks at the Retrieval Price.
