    "question": "Where are my Reserved Assets shown?",
    "answer": "When you place a Bid order, cash is reserved. When you place a Sell order, stocks are reserved. You can check how much cash is reserved in the Nav Bar at the top. Reserved stocks can be viewed in the Portfolio Page, in the Reserved Stocks tab. If you cancel the Bid order, the cash reserved will be returned to you. Similarly, cancelling a Sell order will return your stocks. Please note that Order fee for placing these orders will NOT be returned."

  {
    "question": "What is this Order Fee shown when I place orders?",

    "question": "What is this shortselling you speak of?",
    "answer": "While you will buy a company's stock if you expect its price to go up, you can short sell a company’s stock if you expect its price to go down. In a nutshell, short selling means to sell stocks that you don’t own so that you can buy them back at a lower price.\nFor example, short selling 5 shares of a company XYZ is mathematically equivalent to buying -5 shares of XYZ. When you short sell, your Cash In Hand will increase and your Stock Worth will accordingly decrease such that your Net Worth remains the same (Remember: Net Worth = Cash In Hand + Stock Worth)\nAfter you short sell a company, if the stock price dips below the price you sold it for, then you will have made a profit and vice-versa.\nNote: You can only short sell a maximum of 50 stocks per company."

    "question": "What is the difference between stocks in exchange and stocks in market?",
    "answer": "In the Companies Page, you'll find an entry for Stocks in Exchange as well as an entry for Stocks in Market. Let's clarify the difference between the two :-\nStocks in Exchange - The number of stocks that the Dalal Street Exchange currently holds. This number will be the same as the number found under the Available column in the Exchange Page.\nStocks in Market - The number of stocks that are currently held by all of the players in the game.\nWhen the game begins, the Stocks in Market will be zero since all stocks are initially held by the exchange. As soon as the market opens on Day 1 and players begin buying from the exchange, the number of Stocks in Market will increase and the number of Stocks in Exchange will decrease.\nIf the number of Stocks in Exchange is zero, it means that all shares of this company are currently in the hands of the players. Therefore, you can no longer buy shares from the exchange and instead, you'll have to place Buy Orders on the Trading Page to buy any stock."

    "question": "How does mortgaging work?",
    "answer": "Mortgaging is a great tactic to use if you are in need of cash but are not willing to sell your stocks to other players. It consists of 2 steps :-\nMortgage - In this step, you will be selling your stocks to the exchange at the Deposit Rate (80% of the Current Stock Price).\nRetrieval - Here, you will be retrieving the stocks you initially mortgaged by paying the exchange at the Retrieval Rate (90% of the Mortgaged Price).\n\nNote : After you mortgage a stock, it is no longer a part of your portfolio and hence, will not contribute to your stock worth (until you retrieve it). However, at the end of the game, users will be forced to retrieve all of their mortgaged stocks at the Retrieval Price."
